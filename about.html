    <p>
i grew up in sydney, australia. for my undergrad, i studied civil engineering becoming interested 
in sustainability and water infrastructure. after graduating, i worked as a dams and hydropower 
engineer in sydney and london, uk. five years in and just out of a pandemic, i needed a change. 
i wanted to find more creative and rapid ways of building technology to solve problems for others. 
that led me to the <a href="https://mde.harvard.edu/">design engineering program</a> at harvard. ps70 is a chance 
for me to learn the skills i wish i had been taught in undergrad!
</p>

<p>

<p>
  my interests include music, food, wine, basketball, design, architecture, 
  circular economies, industrial ecology, waste, regenerative agriculture, soil health
   and climate adaptation.
