# the three ideas so far...

  <li> numero uno</li>

being at the graduate school of design, you get a desk in 'the trays', 
the tiered floors of desk cubicles for all students. 
it's beautiful but noisy. there's conversation, people using the toilets and ongoing construction.
to block out the noise, listening to music while working can be great but i can often find it distracting. 
earplugs can work too but i have a mild form of tinnitus (thanks to some bad sound systems). 
the light buzzing i hear is worst when i'm in quiet environments, i'm tired and i'm trying to concentrate i.e. studying.
what i want to build is a generative music device that takes the sounds around me and turns it into music.
i want to connect to headphones and intentionally design the music to align with the pitch that i hear the ringing.

i have myopia/nearsightedness and need to wear spectacles to see distant objects. however, i hate wearing glasses for a multitude of reasons. they fog up; i can't wear them while swimming or skiing or doing anything else that requires me to wear protective goggles; they tend to slip off if i'm sweaty from working out; they get wet in the rain and so on. partially as satire and partially for real reasons, i would love to make glasses with little windshield wipers on them that i can turn on and off using a button. 
</li>
</p>
<p>
  <li> numero tre </li>
  <li>
when i am at home in india over the holidays, i often hear complaints from my parents about how much time they spend ironing and folding clothes and how much they dislike it. i imagine that they would love a machine that could recognise (or be told) what kind of clothing a particular item was and then could iron/steam it and fold it. 
</li>

<p>
of the three ideas i have proposed, i would most want to pursue the third one - a device that can fold clothes by itself. industrialization and mechanization have enabled us to automate a large variety of household chores using appliances like the dishwasher, the roomba, the lawnmower, robots that clean gutters, windows, grills, the list goes on. most commonly, the processes of washing and drying clothing have been automated by the washing machine and the dryer. yet, most people still have to iron/steam and fold their clothes entirely manually. i personally love having ironed and folded clothes since i think they look better - in my closet, in my suitcase, and on me.

<p>
when this idea first struck me, i remembered watching the tv show "the big bang theory" and how one of the characters has an interesting contraption that he uses to fold his clothes.

this seemed like an incredibly simple yet effective tool to fold clothes. however, it did not necessarily eliminate the manual labor required to fold clothes. regardless, i think the general structure of the device that i end up making could draw inspiration from sheldon cooper's folding tool.

even the simplest example of a device that can fold only one specific type of t-shirt would require some form of 3D design and fabrication to create the fold-er, and some form of electronics & microcontroller programming for it to know when to start folding and in what order to move the segments of the fold-er. however, the project could be further complicated in a variety of ways: 

<li>
creating a device that allows you to input the size of a t-shirt (or length and width) and folds the t-shirt based on the size. 
  </li>
<li>
creating a device that allows you to input the size and type of clothing item (t-shirt, shirt, pants, skirt, dress, underwear etc) and folds the object of clothing based on its size and type. 
  </li>
<li>
creating a device that steams or irons the item of clothing before folding it. 
  </li>
<li>
creating a device that can intelligently sense the size and/or type of clothing and then fold it. 
  </li>
</p>

<p>
in an ideal world, the device i create would essentially be able to turn a laundry hamper filled with clean, dry clothes into a pile of ironed/steamed and folded laundry. however, for obvious reasons, the feasibility of building such a device within a semester is low. but if i were to make a device that could fold different types of clothing, i would have to come up with a specific framework for folding clothes - something like the <a href="https://konmari.com/how-to-fold-clothes/">konmari method</a>.

</p>

<p>
i tried looking online for an automatic clothes folding machine and did not find promising results. there had been a previous attempt at creating something like this but it did not seem to work too well. see below the demonstration video of a product created by a failed company called foldimate.

  <p>
there will be a variety of things that i would need to accomplish to be able to build my fold-er, several of which i am not even equipped to anticipate yet. however, i am incredibly excited to undertake my digital fabrication journey with ps70 and challenge myself with this project!
